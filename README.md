This printf project was done by Abimbola Akinshilo and Lordvicus Adienge
We are creating our own printf function.

Here is the outline for the what we will covered in this printf project:

Introduction to printf:
Brief overview of printf and its role in C programming.
The format string: How printf uses format specifiers to control output.

Argument Handling:
How printf handles variable numbers of arguments.
Variadic functions in C.
Parsing the format string to find placeholders.

Processing Format Specifiers:
Understanding format specifiers like %d, %s, %c, etc.
How printf matches format specifiers to arguments.
Handling flags, field width, precision, and length modifiers.

Converting and Formatting:
The role of type conversion in printf.
How to format data for output based on the format specifier.
Handling different data types: integers, characters, strings, floats, etc.

Output Generation:
How printf generates the final formatted output.
Building the output string based on the format and arguments.
Buffering and writing to the standard output.

Error Handling:
Dealing with format string errors.
Handling argument mismatches.
Returning error codes or handling exceptions.

Modifiers and Special Cases:
Handling special format specifiers like %% and %n.
Modifiers like * for dynamic field width and precision.

Memory Management:
If you want your custom printf to allocate memory dynamically, understanding memory management is crucial.

Testing and Debugging:
Strategies for testing your custom printf function.
Debugging common issues.

Optimization and Efficiency:
